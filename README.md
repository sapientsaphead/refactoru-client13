## CLIENT13: Handlebars: Mock Search Engine

#### Objective

Create a data driven UI using Handlebars.

#### Skills
* Creating an Express app
* Understanding the relationship between client and server
* Creating Handlebars templates
* AJAX
* jQuery

#### Resources
* [handlebarsjs.com](http://handlebarsjs.com)
* [dummy data](http://fall2013.refactoru.com/public/samples/search-data.js)

#### Requirements

#### Part I
1. Setup an Express Server
2. Define an Express route, "/search" in your Express app
3. Add the dummy data object listed above as a variable inside of your "/search" route
4. Create a form using Jade that contains a search input (like Google)
5. Add a div below it with the ID "results"
6. Create a Handlebars template for your "results" div
7. When a user enters a value into the search box and presses "Enter", send the entered search term via AJAX to your "/search" endpoint.
8. In your "/search" route take the search term that was setn to your server and find its corresponding description in the "data" object.
9. Use `res.send` to send the JSON back to the client.
10. When you receive the response from the server, compile your Handlebars template `Handlebars.compile` passing the data to it.
11. Take the resulting Handlebars string and append it to your results div using jQuery.

#### Bonus
Get really fancy with the search engine.
1. Modify your code so that you are able to search for any text within the "dummy data" object.
